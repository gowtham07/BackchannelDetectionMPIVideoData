# Backchannel Detection:

Backchanneling during a conversation occurs when
one participant is speaking and another participant
gives a response to the speaker. It can be verbal
cues (“uh-huh”, “hmm”), visual cues(“nodding”,
“facial expressions”) or both, these cues are input
modalities used for backchannel detection. The
backchannel has the important function of encour-
aging current speaker to hold their turn and con-
tinue to speak, which enables smooth conversa-
tion. Predicting a backchannel can be beneficial
for building human like conversational agents or
robots

The above python notebook and report serves as the base for further experiments. We did further experiments on different fusion techniques in transformers for the same task

This project backchannel detection along with other project backchannel estimation is submitted to IJCNN'23 and is accepted. [Official Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01656)

Refer to our official code where we experiment with different fusion tchniques menioned in the published paper. [CodeRepo](https://git.opendfki.de/body_language/ijcnn23-backchannel-detection)
